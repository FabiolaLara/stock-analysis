# Stock-analysis

# Overview of Project
The porpuse for this challenge is to refactor the module 2 code in order to see the time taken while running the macros designed for each point. The information provided here is about stocks analysis. We can see which stocks are convenient at the end of a specific period. We calculated the total dalily volumen for two periods, 2017 and 2018 for each stock, and then the total stocks dialy for all the stock, finally  we see if these stocks retrieve a positive or negative value behavior.


# Results

This first image shows the stocks calculated daily, two bottons were created to run two macros, one for diplaying the values ann the other "Clean Data" to clean the cells, so we dont have to ru the macros as tradicionally.

In this image we can see how the macro "YearValueAnalysis" is running, so we can input the year we want to calculate for the All Stock Analysis sheet.

The next image shows all the stocks with their total daily amount and the Return value at the end of the period selected wheter it be 2017 or 2018.

Finally thee two images show the time taken to retrieve the calculation for each period.

The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
